## Purpose   

This project was created to highlight the development of Go into a high-level programming language. Our goal was to create a program that simulates a retail database. Through this program, we demonstrate some of the important aspects of Go mentioned in our presentation, inlcuding use of functions (funcs) and objects (structs), along with displaying how the data structure, Slices, can be used in Go.   
   
## Description   

The program will allow a customer (you, the user) to register, so you can purchase an item. The user can then provide their bank account number and bank name (multiple account numbers allowed). The user also get a unique customer id, user id, and password registered to yourself. The user is then allowed to purchase items and in different quantities. Discounts can be applied on items. A bill will be generated, and will provide after-information for the purchase.   
   
Additional features are included, such as manager features for adding or deleting items, the ability to delete your account, and more.   
   
This is a small prototype we created for our CS 408 - Programming Languages class. We may expand on this project in the future. If you have any questions regarding the project, you can contact me at any time on Github (tddome).

## How to Install Go and LiteIDE   

1. Download our repository, and extract wherever you'd like.   
  * [GoProject Repository Download](https://github.com/tddome/GoProject/archive/master.zip)   
2. Download and run the installation file for Go.
  * [Golang Download - Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.3.windows-amd64.msi)    
  * [Golang Download - Mac](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.3.darwin-amd64.pkg)    
  * [Golang Download - Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz)    
3. Select all default settings during the Go installation.       
4. Download the archive for LiteIDE.   
  * [LiteIDE Archive Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/liteide/files/)   

## Extracting the LiteIDE Archive

Windows:   

> Extract it into c:\

Mac/Linux:   

> Extract it into /usr/local or $HOME   

## Running our Program   

1. Once LiteIDE is extracted, open LiteIDE. If it asks for the ROOT directory of Go, it will be located in Go/bin. The Go folder will be wherever you extracted the archive, which was specified in the previous step.   
2. Inside LiteIDE, go to File -> Open Folder.   
3. Select the folder where you downloaded our Github repository in Step 1 of installation.   
8. On the left-hand side, you should see a bar entitled File System, which displays the current contents of the folder. If not, there should be a bar on that same left-hand side that has different menu options reading horizontally. One of them should say 6: File System. Click on that to open the view.   
9. In the view, open GoProject.go by double clicking on the file.
10. Press CTRL + R to run the program.   
11. Follow the prompted insturctions in the console displayed in the bottom-half of the window. Clicking inside this window will allow you to input when asked by the program.
