## Purpose   
This project was created to highlight the development of Go into a high-level programming language. Our goal was to create a program that simulates a retail database. Through this program, we demonstrate some of the important aspects of Go mentioned in our presentation, inlcuding use of functions (funcs) and objects (structs), along with displaying how the data structure, Slices, can be used in Go.   
   
## Description   
It will allow a customer to register, so they can purchase an item. They can then provide their bank account number and bank name (multiple account numbers allowed). They'd also have a unique customer id, user id, and password registered to themselves. They can then purchase items and in different quantities. Discounts can be applied on items. A bill will be generated, and will provide after-information for suppliers to send the items in.   

## How to Install   
1. Download our repository through the Clone or download link, or just click [here if you can't find it.](https://github.com/tddome/GoProject/archive/master.zip)   
2. Download and install Go. This can be done at the following link: [Golang Download](https://golang.org/dl/)   
  * Be sure to select the appropiate download for your system.   
3. Select all default settings during the Go installation.       
4. Download the archive for LiteIDE. This can be done at: [LiteIDE Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/liteide/files/).   

> Extracting the archive:
> Windows -> Extract it into c:\
> Mac/Linux -> Extract it into /usr/local or $HOME   

5. Once LiteIDE is extracted, open LiteIDE. If it asks for the ROOT directory of Go, select the directory you chose when installing it in Step 2.   
6.Inside LiteIDE, go to File -> Open Folder.   
7. Select the folder where you downloaded our Github repository in Step 1.   
8. On the left-hand side, you should see a bar entitled File System, which displays the current contents of the folder. If not, there should be a bar on that same left-hand side that has different menu options reading horizontally. One of them should say 6: File System. Click on that to open the view.   
9. In the view, open GoProject.go   
10. Press CTRL + R to run the program.   
11. Follow the prompted insturctions in the console displayed in the bottom-half of the window. Clicking inside will allow you to input when asked by the program.
